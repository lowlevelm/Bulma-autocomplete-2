An Atom package to improve your Bulma workflow.
Updated for 0.9.1

# Installing
Install by running ```$ apm install bulma-autocomplete-2``` in bash,

### notes

- If you would like to use the vue.js functionality, you will need to get a seperate package for vue support. This package is tested to work with ``https://atom.io/packages/language-vue``

- You will have problems with the autocomplete functionality if the dash symbol is included in your non word characters list.
- TODO: automate updates to code
